    <h1>I'm an elite student in Computer Science in Manhattan Hunter Science high School but I'm bsing(I'm lying) through the class so it's all gucci like sushi. </h1>
    <p2>I never liked Computer Science in the first place. I came into this class thinking that I'll get an easy A and learn how to hack bank accounts and steal identities. But it turns out that I actually have to do a lot of work and it's actually type fun. I also developed a crush on Sebastian as well, and he's ode cute (thirsty emoji) </p2>
